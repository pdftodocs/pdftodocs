        <p>Our website address is: <a href="https://www.pdftodocs.com">https://www.pdftodocs.com</a>.</p>
        <p>At PDF to Docs (“We”, “Us”, “Our”), we respect the client’s (“You”, “Your” or “User”) privacy and protect it
            seriously. The use of information collected through our service shall be limited to the purpose of providing
            the

            provide
            our services. PDF to Docs use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will

        </p>
        <h2>Google OAuth Permissions Overview</h2>
        <p>We request specific permissions through Google OAuth to enable the app’s functionality, as explained against
            each
            permission stated below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>See, edit, create, and delete only the specific Google Drive files you use with this app</b> – To
                upload
                the
                newly
                created PDF files to your Google Drive.</li>
            <li><b>See, edit, create and delete all your Google Docs documents</b> – To read the content of Google Docs
                and convert them to PDF.
            </li>
            <li><b>Connect to an external service</b> – To connect to our licensing server.</li>
            <li><b>Display and run third-party web content in prompts and sidebars inside Google applications</b> – To
                display
                the
                add-on
                as a right sidebar that provides the option to convert the PDF to Docs.</li>
            <li><b>Allow this application to run when you are not present</b> – This permission is a requirement for the
                OAuth
                token
                generation, which is essential for enabling the Google Picker API. The Google Picker allows you to
                select
                Google
                Docs that you’d like to add to the PDF conversion list.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Furthermore, in addition to the above functionality, we also retrieve the current user’s email ID. This is
            essential
            for purposes such as storing PDF to Docs license key validation on a per-user basis, tracking our service
            usage
            per
            individual user.</p>
